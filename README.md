SCRIBE project is a blog platform for
articles and real-life stories
and it has no bounds to
whatever content shared.

Personally i have been a volunteer in
the mental 
awareness programs and it made me 
realize when people tell their real 
life experiences it tends to relate
more with the other person especially
if they have gone through the same 
experience.That helped some change
due to the learning, the hope given
and encouragement they received from
that particular story of someone, 
so others had the fear of expressing
themselves or saying what they were 
going through due to being judged, 
rejected and neglected.

So SCRIBES provides a safe space for all such
contents to help in mental stress
DISCALIMER!!This site cannot cure 
serious mental
illness.

Python for the backend, JAVASCRIPT, CSS for the frontend to enable a responsive platform, all these were used to create an amazing and user-friendly site for our users.
